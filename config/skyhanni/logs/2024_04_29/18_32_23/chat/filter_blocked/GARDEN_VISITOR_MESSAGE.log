18:37:41 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fI know what all the others say, but I am the King's true favorite emissary.
18:38:18 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fThe King will surely punish you for this disrespect!
18:38:20 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fMy wheat minion has been slacking recently, I am thinking about giving it an upgrade. He hasn't produced any wheat in years! Every time I check on him, he's empty.
18:38:27 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to keep going like this.
18:38:28 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
18:38:32 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fDon't worry, I'll come back later.
18:38:32 §e[NPC] §aDusk§f: §r§fDusk needs some watermelon to quench his thirst. Dusk would appreciate it.
18:38:38 §e[NPC] §aDusk§f: §r§fDusk is disappointed. Dusk goes away now.
18:38:38 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
18:38:47 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
